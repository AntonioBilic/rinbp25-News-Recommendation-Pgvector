* Deliver personalized news recommendations based on user reading patterns
* Match content semantically rather than relying on keywords alone
* Aggregate and process news from multiple sources automatically
* Track user engagement to continuously improve recommendations
* Provide a clean, intuitive interface for news consumption

### Key Features
* **Vector Embeddings**: Converts article content into semantic vectors
* **Similarity Search**: Finds related content using vector distance calculations
* **Personalized Feed**: Tailors content based on user reading history
* **Content Aggregation**: Automatically collects articles from various sources
* **Engagement Tracking**: Records user interactions to improve recommendations

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Neon PostgreSQL with pgvector**: Stores articles and their vector embeddings
2. **Article Processing Pipeline**: Fetches and embeds content from news sources
3. **FastAPI Backend**: Handles API requests and recommendation logic
4. **React Frontend**: Provides the user interface for news browsing
5. **Embedding Service**: Generates vector representations of articles

### Data Flow
1. The article processor regularly fetches news from configured sources
